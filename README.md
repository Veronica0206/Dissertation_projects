# Estimate Knots in Bilinear Spline Growth Mixture Models with Individually-varying Time Points

– Develop frequentist and Bayesian nonlinear latent growth curve models with the individually-varying time points (ITPs). The nonlinear models with ITPs, which highly extend existing methods to complicated data structures, excel at esti- mating an inflection point (and its variability) of trajectories as well as examining predictors of such inflection points.

– Develop frequentist and Bayesian nonlinear growth mixture models with the ITPs for multiple latent classes and perform cross-validation to select the optimal model. The novel models efficiently separate individuals by their change patterns with considering uncertainty and then identify individual-level factors associated with such unobserved groups.
