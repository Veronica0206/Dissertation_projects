## Part I: Bilinear spline growth models (BLSGMs) w(w/o) time-invariant covariates (TICs) in the framework of individually-varying time points (ITPs)
**Description:** <br>
In this part, we developed four models in unstructured time framework:
- BLSGMs for estimating fixed knots 
- BLSGMs for estimating random knots
- BLSGMs-TICs for estimating fixed knots 
- BLSGMs-TICs for estimating random knots

**Demo:** <br>

**Source Code:** <br>
Will be added later

## Part II: Bilinear spline growth mixture models (BLSGMMs) in the framework of individually-varying time points (ITPs)
In this part, we developed two models in unstructured time framework:
- Two-step BLSGMMs for estimating fixed knots
- One-step BLSGMMs for estimating fixed knots
